# ReadableLog
A python script to make logs out of a spyc session more readable. Used on the beamline SIRIUS at synchrotron SOLEIL.

Run in the folder containing the logs using:
python ReadableLog.ipy filename.log
or for multiple files:
python ReadableLog.ipy *.log

The script will not erase the original logs.
